You know about the power of high-quality data and have successfully managed to generate it on a large scale (500k+) within a rapidly changing environment. You know how to build robust and flexible processes and guardrail them with automation.</p></li><li><p><strong>You have a strong technical CRM background. </strong>Ideally, you have 3+ years of experience in HubSpot. UTM links, booking forms, workflows, multiple pipelines, dashboards, data synchronization between objects, and even the enrichment of data from external sources through custom fields - you have implemented and mastered all of this.</p></li><li><p><strong>Your eye is on the big picture and the detail. </strong>Implementation and maintenance effort, robustness, flexibility, result tracking, documentation, single source of truth, and analysis possibilities - you have taken everything into account when designing the data structure and implementing the process.</p></li><li><p><strong>You’re a problem solver and hold yourself to high standards. </strong>No problem is too big or too hard for you.

We will create a world in which any asset can be owned and traded digitally by anyone, anywhere, and we're looking for ambitious pioneers to join us in this journey. \nUpvest is backed by internationally recognized VCs (Bessemer Venture Partners, Earlybird, Notion Capital, Partech, HV Capital, Speedinvest, ABN AMRO Ventures) and by renowned fintech entrepreneurs (including Maximilian Tayenthal, founder of N26, and Felix Haas, founder of IDnow).\nToday, we count 150+ talented people from 30 different countries. Upvest is based in Berlin but would consider hiring remotely (from within Germany and selected other European countries) for this role. If you do want to move to Berlin though, we’re happy to support your relocation.\nTeam mission\nIn this role you will be working closely with the Taxes and the Corporate Actions Product Engineering teams. Both teams form a central part of Upvest’s core offering and are located in the Investments &amp; Custody Solutions Tribe. \nCurrently our B2B clients and their users from across Europe are onboarding at Upvest. Thus, the mission of the Taxes Product Engineering team is to serve our clients and their end-users with localised and automated tax functionality. You will ascertain that all relevant taxes for selected jurisdictions are processed 100% reliably and are presented in a readily comprehensible manner. This way, our B2B clients can focus on their main business objectives and their users can fully concentrate on their investments. Neither our clients nor their users have to worry about the complex topic of taxes anymore, you and your team will take care of this.\nUpvest’s supported instrument and asset class universe is growing rapidly. As a consequence the pure number and resulting complexity of corporate actions is expanding massively. Corporate actions directly influence shareholder value, security prices and ownership structures. The mission of the Corporate Actions Product Engineering team is to build streamlined and enhanced corporate actions processing capabilities.

However, today it’s impossible to build high-quality products due to the difficulties of processing on-chain data … and this complexity is only increasing as more chains and smart contracts are deployed. Teams are forced to build data infrastructure in-house in order to build their product, distracting them from their core focus.</p>\n<p>Goldsky bridges this gap by automating the creation of end-to-end data pipelines. Our data infrastructure enables hundreds of teams across the industry to build rich, instant, data-driven experiences using on-chain data at blazing fast speeds.</p>\n<p>We’ve raised over $20M from Dragonfly Capital, Felicis Ventures, prominent players in the industry such as 0x Labs, Uniswap Labs, and Protocol Labs, and angel investors including Elad Gil, Plaid founders Zach Perret and William Hockey, and Zhuoxun Yin of Magic Eden.</p>\n<p>Our team built complex, scalable infrastructure with companies across tech, crypto, FinTech, and data analytics – and we’re excited to bring this expertise to solving new and unique challenges with crypto data.</p>\n<p>We hope you’re excited to join us and build the infrastructure that unlocks the rest of web3.</p>\n<p>About the Role</p>\n<p>We launched our first product – Index – last year and are onboarding hundreds of customers to the platform, including Zora, Polymarket, POAP, Arweave, Hashflow, NounsDAO, and others.</p>\n<p>In parallel, we’re launching two new products – Mirror and Fusion – to expand our suite of data tools for customers.</p>\n<p>Our pipeline of current and potential customers is full and we need an experienced sales professional to help capitalize on this momentum and keep up with demand.

This is your chance to build things that help create a better place for all of us.</li><li><strong>4-day work week and lots of holidays.</strong> Mondays are flex days, meaning you’re free to take them off if you’re caught up on your work. Plus, we’re closed for nearly a full week at Thanksgiving (November), and two weeks at the end of the year, plus a bunch of other days, too. Work-life balance FTW!</li><li><strong>High performance, no jerks.</strong> You'll collaborate with good people who believe in doing great work.</li><li><strong>Best Place to Work (and that’s not just our opinion).</strong> We’ve been named a Best Place to Work by the Inc. 5000 and Washington Business Journal.</li></ul><div><strong><br>Also, life is short.<br></strong><br></div><div>We believe that if we’re going to spend a decent chunk of our time working, it should be for a good purpose.

You’re ultimately responsible for their success. That means balancing your project team and resources, to stay on time, on budget, on spec, and on vision (all while delivering an exceptional client experience).</li><li>In pursuit of this success, we’ll make sure you have the tools and support to make that happen.</li><li>Most of the engagements you work on will be related to websites in some way — whether that’s building something new, or making something better.</li><li>You’ll be scheduling, planning, coordinating, connecting, and doing, as you collaborate with our strategists, designers, copywriters, developers, and others.</li><li>Sometimes, you’ll need to lead a room or take charge of a situation. You should feel comfortable doing so, in a positive way.<br>You must understand the full life cycle of a digital/website project. You don’t need to be an expert in all facets of the work, but you do need a high-level of how all of the pieces fit together.</li></ul><div><strong><br>If you work here, you’ll:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Serve as the primary contact with clients consulting on end-to-end web design projects and ongoing retainers.</li><li>Ensure the overall success of the client’s web projects. Must be able to own the vision for a project and know what it takes to align deliverables with that vision.</li><li>Manage internal resources and deliverables in collaboration with agency departments.</li><li>Manage project timeline including timely delivery of the project and associated deliverables.</li><li>Plan project phases and client billing.</li><li>Manage administrative aspects of each client project from paperwork and invoicing to managing records in a CRM (Hubspot), PM platform, Wiki, etc.</li><li>Develop and grow ongoing relationships with clients, colleagues, and contractors with a focus on the human-to-human experience being a delightful one.</li></ul><div><strong><br>You’ll do well in this job if you have:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Minimum 3 years of continuous industry experience in web design (or comparable) project management, with proven experience in web project conception from inception to launch.</li><li>Proficiency in all MS Office/G Suite applications, basic HTML syntax, writing and editing, and general knowledge of business, marketing, and technology fields.</li><li>Proficiency with project management software and techniques. Understanding of key project management tenets including project charters and waterfall vs agile methodologies.</li><li>Familiarity with strategic consulting, development of Information Architectures and wireframes, and development of Functional Requirements for technical projects.</li><li>Familiarity with managing CMS implementation projects and working knowledge of content management systems. Experience with WordPress, Drupal, or other CMS products is a plus.</li><li>This role is comparable to a project manager, you need to be able to manage complex web engagements with grace under pressure and occasionally cook up solutions on the fly.</li><li>Have a genuine interest in staying on top of industry trends and best practices and be “game” for taking on new challenges and learning new technologies.</li></ul><div><strong><br>However, maybe don’t apply if:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>You prefer to work on a single big project at a time. We all have to do a bit of juggling around here, and while we wish we could pour ourselves into just one thing for weeks at a time to make it perfect, that’s often not the reality.</li><li>You’ve ever said “that’s not my job” or “that’s below my pay grade.” While we try to utilize everyone in the best way we possibly can, sometimes things can get dicey and we have to pitch in to help reach the finish line.</li></ul><div><strong>Full disclosure:</strong> This isn’t the place for everyone. You’ll have a lot of autonomy, but the expectations are high, the work is fast-paced, and the hats are many. We’re looking for people with grit who take ownership, see the big picture, and are always thinking about how we can do even better the next time.<br><br></div><div><br><strong>If you work here:<br></strong><br></div><div>You’ll get a competitive salary, unlimited time off, a flexible schedule, the ability to work wherever you want, a personal development budget, federal holidays and multiple weeks off at the end of the year to recharge.

There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. No Micro-Management. </strong>Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off.

Most of our best people did nothing remotely related to their current roles, so if you've never done anything like this before, don't sweat it. We hire 100x more for potential than existing knowledge. The Big Bang requirement still stands though.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--Do I need a college degree?--</strong></div><div>You just need to be awesome.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--Are there any geographic restrictions?--</strong></div><div>As long as you are in a country that doesn’t have active sanctions from the US government, we are interested. Our founder isn’t known for respecting the government much, but they have all the guns, so…</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--Why don’t you just use online summaries?--</strong></div><div>Definitely a fair question. I have literally no idea what anybody gets out of these services. Their summaries are garbage. No regular human will actually change their actions from reading them. They basically operate on the wrong theory of how humans learn.</div><div><br></div><div>And ChatGPT summaries are absolutely useless. Maybe in the future they won’t suck, but we have been universally unimpressed (though we otherwise love ChatGPT).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--What kind of things will I be reading/summarizing?--</strong></div><div>It will be extremely wide and eclectic. Everything from business books to ancient philosophy to academic papers to economics videos to therapy blog posts. If you don’t love learning about just about literally anything and everything (like our founder), this might not be the role for you.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--Will I be reading/summarizing anything controversial?--</strong></div><div>There is literally nothing off limits. If you aren’t comfortable reading (and defending) everything from Marx or Rothbard to people 10x more controversial than them, this isn’t the place for you. We value truth above all else, even if it’s unfashionable or uncomfortable.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--How much will I be reading?--</strong></div><div>A very wide variety of things. We haven’t hired for this role before so we really don’t know what is 100% reasonable to expect but our founder reads (or listens to) the equivalent of 2 books per week. You’ll likely need to be on a faster pace than him since this will be your job.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--What is JLS University?--</strong></div><div>We’ll eventually give you a lot more information about it, but the short version is that it's our internal university to help our people become hyper capable. It is not fully built out, but we currently have probably 2ish years of material we want people to work through. If all goes well, you’ll help teach and expand the curriculum.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--This sounds pretty good, though I’m still skeptical that this isn’t a pyramid scheme.--</strong></div><div>You sound just like our tax auditor!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>--That doesn’t resolve any of my fears, but what do I need to do to apply?--</strong></div><div>Please submit your information on the following page to apply. We promise to respond within 5-10 business days even if our answer is No.</div><div><br></div><div>There will be multiple steps in this process, FYI, including a long written application, interviews with potentially a few different people, and paid work test(s). Hiring the right people is really hard and very expensive if we do it poorly, so we have to front-load the process. I'm sorry about that and thank you for sticking with us.</div><div><br></div><div>Once you’re in our pipeline though, I would anticipate giving you a final answer within a few weeks, depending on how it goes. We definitely don’t want to string you along, and as long as you do what we ask, we promise to tell you “yes” or “no”, and to not just ghost you (like everybody I match with on Tinder).</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you for your time and interest, and I hope we can work together soon!</div><div><br><br></div>",

We're Forerunner.</p>\n<p>We believe that climate adaptation is a necessity, not a luxury, and communities deserve access to powerful software that helps them plan for the future. The challenge of climate change is complex – it implicates how municipalities plan, manage capital, and communicate to both residents and higher levels of government. Forerunner helps local communities do these things better by empowering them to access, understand, and mobilize local-level flood risk data at scale.</p>\n<p>The Role</p>\n<p>The engineering team at Forerunner strives to be small but dedicated, working relentlessly to help local governmental bodies and their floodplain managers reason about the flooding risks that all communities face in the USA. The domain is complicated, nuanced, and rapidly changing, and we at Forerunner break down this complexity for our users so they can do what truly matters - fight against climate change and the possible loss of homes in the case of flooding.</p>\n<p>Engineers at Forerunner can work remotely from anywhere within the United States, so long as they are willing to work on either Eastern or Central timezones. We offer schedule flexibility and ask for accountability in return. We are unable to sponsor H1-B visas at this time, so permanent residency or citizenship is required.</p>\n<p>Our tech stack and other engineering tools include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Typescript / React.js / React Native frontend with jest for testing</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>GraphQL API powered by a Node.js / Typescript backend with jest for testing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Postgres as our database, alongside heavy use of postgis</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>git, Github and Github Actions for code review and CI</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deployment to AWS using ECS and similar products</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A variety of other cloud providers, such as GCP</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While expertise with all of the technologies above is by no means not necessary, a working understanding of at least a few of them is required.</p>\n<p>We strongly encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply - the problem of climate change has an impact on all of us, and we want to reflect that within our team's composition.\nWhat You'll Do</p>\n<p>A Senior Full-Stack Engineer at Forerunner has the following responsibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Build, test, and review software on a day-to-day basis, working within our frontends, backends, and with the underlying data modeling that underpins them. This means working on a postgres query one day and on a React component the next, all the while making sure this work is adequately tested.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do the occasional dev-ops and support work. We use AWS as our cloud provider, but we have no dedicated SRE or dev-ops team, and so sometimes engineers may have to help with the plumbing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Occasionally pair-program with and help mentor peers.

Domain expertise is always hard to come by and benefits from dedicated time and curiosity - we are learning a lot from our partners and this reflects in the work we do, so ask questions.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Communicate clearly, whether in a stand-up meeting, planning meeting, or otherwise. We're a small team working entirely remotely, which requires us to be prompt and clear with both written and spoken communication.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What We Offer</p>\n<p>Forerunner is an early stage company with an interdisciplinary team. We are motivated by seemingly intractable problems and work hard to support one another.</p>\n<p>We're mission-driven. Our mission orients our business strategy and pushes us to work with a sense of urgency. We’re in the weeds - our entire team spends time engaging with our partners in the field to better understand the real-world problems they face.</p>\n<p>We're a small team. As a member of our growing team, you will quickly become an invaluable part of our organization and have a meaningful impact on our business and technical direction. We welcome unique perspectives and backgrounds. Your opinion matters and we hope you'll share it.</p>\n<p>We build each other up. A team works best when its members are adequately equipped with the tools to tackle the problems they are facing. Forerunner strives to provide adequate feedback and appropriate learning opportunities to help all its team members expand their skills.</p>\n<p>We want you to be happy and healthy.
